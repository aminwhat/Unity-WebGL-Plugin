# Unity WebGL Plugin

This is Unity Webgl Sample that was very hard for me to code =(

The Scenario was to send audio and video throughout the unity webgl by

- recording the voice and send it
- pick the audio file from hard and send it

I Hope this is useful for others.

Tested on Unity 2021.3f.17(or something like this *0_0* )
